# Analysis

This section includes technical analysis done using Jupyter notebooks and R markdown.
Each sub-section highlights a different script, which performs data analysis and visualization for the project's case study location, San Jose, Costa Rica.

* The R markdown script, WeightedOverlayRasters, pre-processes raster data used in the Hotspot Stoplight Project for visualization and cluster analysis.
* The Jupyter Notebooks script, HotspotClustering, performs k means clustering and data visualization on three data outputs from WeightedOverlayRasters, using them to make high-level planning recommendations for urban development and conservation prioritization.
