## About the Project

The Hotspot Stoplight Project is a partnership between UN Habitat and The McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania. The Project seeks to develop a methodology for the integration of regionally-specific climate risk, biodiversity loss, and land cover change projections into a cartographic product and a high-resolution urban suitability index we call the 'Stoplight for Urban Development.'

The ultimate goal of this project is to use these projections to inform urban design and planning processes, bringing together data science and design to support the goals of de-siloing knowledge, projecting urban expansion to better understand where habitat loss is likely to occur, reduce habitat degradation and destruction, increase the accuracy of ecosystem services accounting, and promote deeper understanding among urban and regional planners of the interconnectedness of the natural and built environments.

This website attempts to gather together some of the preliminary findings of this research, focusing on the case study city of San Jose, Costa Rica.
